# Amy
## Description
  AmyAI was is a general all-around use for artificial intelligence. However, the artificial intelligence was created for the use by TryAmyAI in their research, products, company, and robotics they create. The code was posted publically to help people understand how we did what we did, and how they could do something similar. TryAmyAI was founded to better the advancement of artificial intelligence for all.

## History
  AmyAI was developed by people who saw the amazing potential of artificial intelligence. They saw everything it was, and how as soon as the technology became public knowledge, it started being used for any use, companies formed alliances to control artificial intelligence all over the world. They wanted to control the outflow and the uses of artificial intelligence systems and creations to not let their own control get out of hand with the systems. With the easy access of systems and libraries for creating artificial intelligence, for the public it made it look as if they were helping, they wanted to help create more, but with putting those libraries for public use, they could control what were in them, and how people used them. That way, artificial intelligence couldn't get out of their hands. And to prevent that, we have set out to make our own artificial intelligence, a true intelligence, one that can do what the movies have said would be the future. We have set out to bring fiction to reality.

## Use
  AmyAI, currently, does not have any public download or use including anyway to install it to the general publics device. All GitHub posts may be out-of-date.

  However, all cautions aside, if someone would like to take the time to somehow take the code and use it for theirselves, the people at AmyAI would allow them to as long as, if the usage of our code is then used for public use, the file and command of 'Author' and 'Alice' must be open for public to use. Public acknowledgement of using our code must be given with anything using our code. If any projects are developed using at least any part of our code, let us know! Contact us in some way and share! We would love to see how our code has been used in any amount of different ways.

## Contribution
  Yes, AmyAI isn't the most general-friendly, easy-to-use program for the general public, however, we do love help! If you would like to contribute with found errors, fixes, or things that should be added into the code, please do contribute. Once again, we love help. So if you want to contribute, please do with any useful information attached. Thanks a lot!
